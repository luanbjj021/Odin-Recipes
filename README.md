# Odin-recipes
This project is a recipe website built using HTML, designed to be simple, functional, and visually appealing. It features various recipes organized in a clear and accessible way, including descriptions, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.  

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated key HTML skills, such as creating a semantic structure, organizing content with proper tags, and integrating elements like lists, tables, and links. I will also have improved my ability to design basic web pages that offer a great user experience.
